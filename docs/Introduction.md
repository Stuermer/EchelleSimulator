Introduction
============


Echelle spectrographs are named after its main optical component - an *Echelle* *grating* (from French Ã©chelle). They are used
to obtain high-resolution, cross-dispersed spectra and are widely used in astronomy.

Echelle gratings have a large ruling spacing and are used in high diffraction order allowing for a high spectral resolution.
Spectra of different diffraction orders are overlapping and a second component - a so called *cross* *disperser* - is used to
seperate the individual orders. Compared to an echelle grating, the dispersion of the cross disperser is low and a typical
choice is a low dispersion grating, a prism or a grism.

On the whole, an echelle spectrograph produces a 2D spectrum, where the positions of a certain wavelength depends
 on details of the spectrograph optics, its echelle parameters and its cross disperser.
